Roundcube Webmail `qmailforward` plugin
==============================
This plugin adds the ability for `qmail` users to edit their forwards from within
`Roundcube` with no need to ask their administrators for doing that via `qmailadmin`.
`qmailforward` saves the forwards to `MySQL` database.

Unlike the `managesieve` plugin, from which this plugin is inspired but which only
apparently behaves in the same way, it does not use the sieve rules but it saves
the forwards on the database, also preserving the possibility of saving a record that
enables the copy of messages on the mailbox. In this case the execution of the favorite delivery
agent is launched, which can also be set from the configuration file. 

Using this method instead of sieve rules allows `qmail` users to keep the SPF policies in effect.

Inspiration and part of the code for this plugin was taken from the `sauserprefs` and `managesieve` plugins. The latter one provides an identical html form.

Requirements
------------
* `vpopmail` configured with virtual aliases `--enable-valias` and patched to modify the `valias` database schema. You can manually modify the database schema as shown below.
* [`vpopmail` version 5.6.x](https://notes.sagredo.eu/en/qmail-notes-185/installing-and-configuring-vpopmail-81.html) configured with `--enbable-defaultdelivery` if you want to manage the `dot-qmail` files and install `dovecot-lda` to use `sieve` together with `qmail` forwards. Look at [this page](https://notes.sagredo.eu/en/qmail-notes-185/sql-valias-with-sieve-solution-for-qmail-new-patches-and-roundcube-plugin-301.html) for more info.
* you may want to upgrade [`qmailadmin`](https://notes.sagredo.eu/en/qmail-notes-185/qmailadmin-23.html) as well if using [`vpopmail` version 5.6.x](https://notes.sagredo.eu/en/qmail-notes-185/installing-and-configuring-vpopmail-81.html).

Install
-------
* Place this plugin folder into the plugins directory of `Roundcube`
* Add `qmailforward` to `$config['plugins']` in your `Roundcube` config
* If you are switching to valiases the table will be created for you at first
  access. If you already have the valias table but it's still empty, just erase
  it and let `vpopmail` create it for you.
* If your valias table already exists and it contains records that you don't
  want to loose, then execute the following query. Drop any `PRIMARY KEY` if you
  already have one.

```sql
USE vpopmail;
ALTER TABLE `valias` ADD `valias_type` TINYINT(1) NOT NULL DEFAULT '1' COMMENT '1=forwarder 0=lda' FIRST;
ALTER TABLE `valias` ADD `copy` TINYINT(1) NOT NULL DEFAULT '0' COMMENT '0=redirect 1=copy&redirect' AFTER `valias_line`;
ALTER TABLE `valias` ADD `id` INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT FIRST, ADD PRIMARY KEY (`id`);
ALTER TABLE `valias` ADD INDEX (`valias_type`, `alias`, `domain`); 
```

Configuration
-------------
* The default config file is [*plugins/qmailforward/config.inc.php.dist*](config.inc.dist.php)
* Copy the options you have to modify to *plugins/qmailforward/config.inc.php*
* You must set at least the database connection string
